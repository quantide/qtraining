Do
================================

## `do`
Note: all the exercises of this section are based on the `flights` dataset.


```r
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
```


### Exercise 1
Calculate quartiles (25-, 50- and 75-percentiles) of delay at arrival per origin. Put all three quartiles in a unique column.




### Exercise 2
Redo the previous exercise putting the three quartiles in three different columns (hint: use `summarise()`).




### Exercise 3
Calculate mean and standard deviation of delay at arrival per origin. Put both statistics in a unique column.




### Exercise 4
Redo the previous exercise putting mean and standard deviation in two different columns (hint: use `summarise()`).
