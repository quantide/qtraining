```{r options, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}

```{r first, include=TRUE, purl=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# `arrange()`

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of filtering or selecting rows, it reorders them. It takes a data frame, and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:

```{r}
# Order `bank` data frame by date and age in ascending order
arrange(bank, date, age)
```

Use `desc()` to order a column in descending order:

```{r}
# Order `bank` data frame by age in descending order
arrange(bank, desc(age))
```

The previous code is equivalent to:

```{r}
bank[order(bank$date, bank$age), ]
bank[order(desc(bank$age)), ]
```
