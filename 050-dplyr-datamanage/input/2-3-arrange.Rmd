```{r options, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
source("options.R")
```

```{r first, include=FALSE, purl=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# This code chunk contains R code already described in the previous chapters
# that is required by following examples
require(dplyr)
require(qdata)
data(bank)
```


# `arrange()`

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of filtering or selecting rows, it reorders them. It takes a data frame, and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:

```{r}
bank <- tbl_df(bank)
arrange(bank, date, age)
```

Use `desc()` to order a column in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(bank, desc(age))
```

The previous code is equivalent to:

```{r}
bank[order(bank$date, bank$age), ]
bank[order(desc(bank$age)), ]
```
