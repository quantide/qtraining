title: "Arrange Data"

```{r options, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
options(width = 108)
```

```{r first, include=TRUE, purl=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# load packages and data
require(tidyverse) # alternatively require(dplyr)
require(qdata)
data(bank) 
```


# `arrange()`

`arrange()` changes the order of the data frame rows. The first argument is the name of the data frame, and the second and subsequent are column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:

```{r}
# Order `bank` data frame by date and age in ascending order
arrange(bank, date, age)
```

Use `desc()` to order by descending order:

```{r}
# Order `bank` data frame by age in descending order
bank %>% arrange(desc(age))
```

Notice that the previous code is equivalent to:

```{r}
bank[order(bank$date, bank$age), ]
bank[order(desc(bank$age)), ]
```
