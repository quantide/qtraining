Most of the packages that will be used in the course are part of the so-called "tidyverse". _Packages in the tidyverse are packages that share a common philosophy of data management and that are designed to work well together._ (www.tidyverse.org) 


![<small>Some of the tidyverse packages. Source: www.tidyverse.org</small>](./images/tidyverse.png)


Please check out the manifesto for further details on the philosophy underlining tidyiverse:  [the tidy tools manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html). 

The whole tidyverse can be installed with the single (yet for long runnning!) line command .

```{r tidyverse, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The package `tidyverse` is thus just the collection of packages in the tidyverse. 

In order to start using the tidyverse, you need to load them:

```{r tidyverse3}
require(tidyverse)
```

This will load the core packages (as listed) that are a set of packages that are used in basically any analysis. 

Among the core packages installed, in this course we will use the following:

* dplyr, for data manipulation
* tidyr, for tidying data
* readr, for importing flat files
* tibble, for tibbles creation and coercion

`dplyr` is a modern `R` package which provides functions to manage data in a more intuitive and efficient way than base `R`.  
The starting point for more information about `dplyr` is the official website providing documentation: [dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html).  

`tidyr` is a modern `R` package which provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset.  
The starting point for more information about `tidyr` is the official website providing documentation: [tidyr: Easily Tidy Data with 'spread()' and 'gather()' Functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html).  

`readr` allows you to import flat data files into R and it is well harmonized with the rest of the tidyverse.  
The starting point for more information about `readr` is the official website providing documentation: [readr: Read tabular data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html)

`tibble` provides a `tbl_df` class that offers better checking and printing capabilities than traditional data frames.  
The starting point for more information about `tibble` is the official website providing documentation: [tibble: Simple data frames](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/index.html)

In addition to the core packages, it also installs other tidyverse packages that will be used in this course and that are useful, for instance, when working with non-numeric variables or when importing data from external sources. We will not list all these packages here, but for a better overview of the main packages in the tidyverse please check out the following link https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse. If you want to load packages that are not in the tidyverse core, you should load them one by one.

Tidyverse as well as the packages that compose it are fairly new, thus we should expect that the composition of tidyverse may change as well as the releases of the packages that compose tidyiverse. You can check that all tidyverse packages are up-to-date with the following line command:

```{r tidyverse_update, eval = FALSE}
tidyverse_update()
```


# Datasets Used in the Examples of This Course

The following data sets are used in the examples of this course.

## The `bank` Dataset

Most of the examples of this course require the dataset `bank` which is included in the `qdata` package.

```{r bank, message=FALSE}
require(qdata)
data(bank)
bank
str(bank)
```

This dataset contains information on phone calls related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The data frame has 20 variables and 45211 observations. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The data are ordered by call id (and also by date, from May 2008 to November 2010). The full dataset was described and analyzed in:

S. Moro, R. Laureano and P. Cortez. Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology. In P. Novais et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of the European Simulation and Modelling Conference - ESM'2011, pp. 117-121, Guimar√£es, Portugal, October, 2011. EUROSIS.


## Other Datasets

Some single sections of this course contain examples also refered to other datasets included in the `qdata` package:

* `people`, which is related with information on gender, area, weight and height of 1806 Italian people:

```{r people, message=FALSE}
data(people)
people
str(people)
```

* `mtcars`, which was extracted from the analogous data frame of package `datasets`; it contains information on 32 cars:

```{r mtcars, message=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
mtcars
str(mtcars)
```

* `comuni`, `province`, `regioni` and `ripartizioni`, which contain information on the Italian districts (8003 "comuni", 110 "province", 20 "regioni" and 5 "ripartizioni"). They were all obtained as subsets or by summarizing the `italia` data frame:

```{r italia, message=FALSE}
data(italia)
italia
str(italia)
```

* `usopen` and `wimbledon`, which contain information about the gentlemen U.S. Open nd Wimbledon finals from 1968 to 2015:

```{r tennis, message=FALSE}
data(usopen)
usopen
str(usopen)
data(wimbledon)
wimbledon
str(wimbledon)
```
