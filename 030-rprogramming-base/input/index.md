title: "About This Course"
---


This course offers the tools for efficient programming with R. First basic concepts, such as environments, R objects and loops, are reviewed. Second, R is presented as a functional programming language as well as an object oriented language.  

In the last part of this course elements for debugging and profiling code are provided, together with tools for parallelising your code. In order to make the code reproducible the attention is then focused on packages creation and code documentation.
