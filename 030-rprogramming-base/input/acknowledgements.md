I have taken efforts in writing this manual. It is the result of several years of courses about R programming. 

I would like to thank my colleague, Veronica Giro, for her contributions and for the long hours she spent checking and reviewing my messy writing.

However, it would not have been possible without the kind support and help of many individuals and without the sharing of knowledge, information, ideas, doubts and even criticisms of many individuals on the internet. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of them.

I finally express my sincere excuses to all researchers and R enthusiasts I have borrowed any knowledge from without mentioning them. This was not intentional, simply I had not always tracked my sources. If this is the case, please contact me directly and I will be more than happy to include any appropriate reference in this manual.
