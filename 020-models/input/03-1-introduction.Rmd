```{r setup, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
require(knitr)

opts_chunk$set(list(dev = 'png',fig.cap='',fig.show='hold',dpi=100,fig.width=7, fig.height=7,fig.pos='H!',fig.path="images/oth-"))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```


In this chapter other options to analyze more complex problems are presented.  
Some of these options could be considered simple variations on GLM models (e.g., Multinomial models), while other might be considered true extensions of GLMs.
