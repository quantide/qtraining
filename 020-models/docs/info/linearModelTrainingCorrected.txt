"Statistical Models with R" Course
The course scheduled for XX-XX-XXXX. If you are interested in this course, please contact training@quantide.com.

Course description
This two days course shows a wide variety of statistical models with R ranging from Linear Models (LM) to Generalized Linear Models (GLM) modelling, in order to provide an exhaustive overview of statistical linear models with R.
The course will follow a step-by-step approach from simplest to more complex models to illustrate the R capabilities on modeling. Some theoretical introductions are given in course materials.
Brief introductions to modeling with Mixed Effects, GAM, Neural Networks and Trees are also provided.

Who should attend this course
Anyone who is already using R and wants to get an overview of statistical models with R. Some background in theoretical statistics and probability is required.
