```{r options, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
source("options.R")
```

```{r first, include=FALSE, purl=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# This code chunk contains R code already described in the previous chapters
# that is required by following examples
require(dplyr)
require(qdata)
data(bank)
```


# `summarise()`

The last verb is `summarise()`, which collapses a data frame to a single row:

```{r}
summarise(bank, mean_balance = mean(balance, na.rm = TRUE))
summarise(bank, max_balance = max(balance, na.rm = TRUE), min_balance = min(balance, na.rm = TRUE))
```
