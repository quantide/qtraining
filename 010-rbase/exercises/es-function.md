# Writing R functions
## Writing R functions
### Exercise 1

Write a function, named `compute_summary`, which computes: sum, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers. The function arguments should be the two numbers, named as: `x` and `y`. The function should return all amounts computed. 



### Exercise 2

Write a function, named `compute_gain`, which computes the income by multiplying the amount produced for sale price and then computes the gain by subtracting the costs to income.  
The function arguments should be: `amount`, `price`, and `costs`; `price` should have a default value equal to 5. The function should return the gain.
