```{r options, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
source("options.R")
```

```{r first, include=FALSE, purl=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# This code chunk contains R code already described in the previous chapters
# that is required by following examples
require(dplyr)
require(qdata)
data(bank) 
bank <- tbl_df(bank)
```


# `arrange()`

Function `arrange()` reorders a data frame by one or more variables. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns:

You may want to order the `bank` data frame by the balance of the account in ascending order:

```{r}
arrange(bank, balance)
```

or in descending order by using function `desc()` within `arrange()`: 

```{r}
arrange(bank, desc(balance))
```

You can order a data frame by one or more than one variables.

Ordering data frame bank by `age` first and descending `ballance` afterward requires:


```{r}
arrange(bank, age , desc(balance))
```


<!--

As any `dplyr` verb, `arrange()` can be mingled with any other verb in order to efficiently manipulate your data. 

If you want to know the top three `balance` by age you may write:

```{r}
arrange(bank, age , desc(balance)) %>% 
  group_by(age) %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 3) %>%
  select(id, age, balance)
```
