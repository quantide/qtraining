I have taken efforts in writing this manual. However, it would not have been possible without the kind support and help of many individuals. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all of them.  

I would like to thank my colleagues, Nicola Sturaro and Enrico Tonini, for their contributions and for the long hours they spent checking and reviewing my messy writing.  

I would finally like to express my special gratitude to Hadley Wickham for providing and sharing his research on the `R` package `dplyr`. Without his contribution, most parts of this manual would never have been written.
