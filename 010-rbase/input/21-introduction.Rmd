There are different types of objects in R, which can be divided in:

* data objects
* function object
 
**Data objects** are specific types of data structures by which is possible to organize data. The most important are:

* vectors 
* matrices 
* lists 
* factors
* data frames

**Function object** refers to operation done on data.

We will deepen these two categories of R objetcs in the following chapters.
