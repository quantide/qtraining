# Reports with R Markdown

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}  
options(width = 108)
show_chunk <- function(x){
  cat(x)
}
require(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.pos = 'center')
```  

```{r g0, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("./images/flow-info.png", dpi=150)
```

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. R Markdown allows us to turn our analysis into high quality documents, reports, presentations and dashboards.

We can use a single R Markdown file to both:

* save and execute code
* generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support multiple programming languages like: R, Python, and SQL. It support also dozens of static and dynamic output formats, including HTML, PDF, MS Word, Beamer, HTML5 slides, Tufte-style handouts, books, dashboards, shiny applications, scientific articles, websites, and more. 

## Installation

You can install the R Markdown package from CRAN as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```


## Markdown Basics

This is an R Markdown file, a plain text file that has the extension `.Rmd`:

```{r g1, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.cap="R Markdown File", fig.pos='h'}
include_graphics("images/rmd-1.png", dpi=200)
```

Notice that the file contains three types of content:

* An (optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`
* R code chunks surrounded by ` ``` `
* text mixed with simple text formatting

Markdown is a simple formatting language designed to make authoring content easy for everyone. Rather than writing complex markup code (e.g. HTML or LaTeX), Markdown enables the use of a syntax much more like plain-text email.

### Basic rules for text 

This section provides quick references to the most commonly used R Markdown syntax.

```{r g2, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.cap="Source: R Markdown Cheat Sheet", fig.pos='h'}
include_graphics("images/rmd-cheatsheet.png", dpi=100)
```

## Rendering Output

To generate a report from the file, run the `render` command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(rmarkdown)
render("example.Rmd")
```

Otherwise, use the "Knit" button in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click or the keyboard shortcut _Ctrl + Shift + K_.


```{r g3, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.cap="R Markdown Output", fig.pos='h'}
include_graphics("images/rmd-3.png", dpi=200)
```


R Markdown generates a new file that contains selected text, code, and results from the .Rmd file. The new file can be a finished web page, PDF, MS Word document, slide show, notebook, handout, book, dashboard, package vignette or other format.
