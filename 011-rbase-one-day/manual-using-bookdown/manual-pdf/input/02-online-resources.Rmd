```{r setup, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(knitr)

R strength is its community, which is distributed and keeps growing all over the World!

```{r g1, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure generated by Ramnath Vaidyanathan"}
include_graphics("images/r-users-distribution.png", dpi=150)
```

Thanks to its community, R can boast a wide variety of online resources, free and otherwise, to learn more about it, ranging from websites, blogs and commercial support tools.

Let us have a look at the most important.

## The R-project and R Licence

R is supported by a wide community of academic users, professors, companies and developers. This community composes the so-called "R-project". The "R-project" is supported by the "R Foundation". The R Foundation is a not for profit organisation, working in the public interest.

R is an official part of the Free Software Foundation's GNU project. The R Foundation has similar goals to other open source software foundations like the Apache Foundation or the GNOME Foundation. R is free and open source software. It is released under the GPL (version 2) licence.

R is free:

 - you can have R without paying for it (freeware);
 - you can copy and re-use the software (free software);
 - you can access source code and modify it (open source).


### R-project Website

The R-project website [(www.r-project.org)](http://www.r-project.org/) is the starting point for R materials.

The website contains:

 - the software and packages;
 - the search engine interface (the same queries can be submitted with the RSiteSearch ('query') function within R);
 - the on-line documentation both in HTML and in PDF format. The HTML version can be accessed with the `help.start()` function within R;
 - the R Journal. The R Journal is the open access, refereed journal of the R project. It features short to medium length articles covering topics that might be of interest to users or developers of R;
 - the interface to the mailing list;
 - the wiki, suggested books and many others.

The on-line documentation includes the following manuals. These manuals have been written by the R Development Core Team itself and contain precious information.

 - *An Introduction to R* gives an introduction to the language and how to use R for doing statistical analysis and graphics.
 - *Writing R Extensions* covers how to create your own packages, write R help files, and the foreign language (C, C++, Fortran, ...) interfaces.
 - *R Data Import/Export* describes the import and export facilities available either in R itself or via packages which are available from CRAN.
 - *R Installation and Administration*.

Other manuals and tutorials provided by R users can be downloaded from the R-project website [(cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html)](http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html).

Mailing lists is the most important tool to contact the R community. Mailing lists can be accessed from the R-project website [(www.r-project.org/mail.html)](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html).

There are five general mailing lists devoted to R:

 - _R-announce_:
   This list is for major announcements about the development of R and the availability of new code.
 - _R-packages_:
   This list is for announcements as well, usually on the availability of new or enhanced contributed packages (on CRAN, typically).
 - _R-help_:
   The "main" R mailing list, for discussion about problems and solutions using R, announcements about the availability of new functionality for R and documentation of R, comparison and compatibility with S-plus, and for the posting of nice examples and benchmarks. 
 - _R-devel_:
   This list is intended for questions and discussion about code development in R.
 - _R-package-devel_:
   This list is to get help about package development in R.

## Other Online Resources

It is very difficult estimate how many sites about R are on-line. However, Google returns 224.000.000 sites searching "R stat blog". Also if only the 0.1% of these sites talk about R, it means almost 220.000 sites about R.

R-bloggers [(www.r-bloggers.com)](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) is a blog aggregator of content collected from bloggers who write about R. R-bloggers contains R news and tutorials contributed by hundreds of R bloggers.

We suggest you to visit MilanoR [(www.milanor.net)](http://www.milanor.net/), which is the blog of R users in the Milan Area. Its aim is to exchange knowledge, learn and share tricks and techniques and provide R beginners with an opportunity to meet more experienced users.

Other useful websites about R are:

 - Stack Overflow [(www.stackoverflow.com)](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a website that features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming, among which r.
 - Quick-R [(www.statmethods.net)](http://www.statmethods.net/) is a useful on-line guide to R. It provides many examples and useful tips.
 - R seek [(rseek.org)](http://rseek.org/) uses Google to search in a selected list of websites about R.


### R Commercial Support

While R is an open source project supported by the community developing it, some companies strive to provide commercial support and/or extensions for their customers. 


#### Microsoft Corporation

Microsoft Corporation provides Microsoft R Open [(www.mran.microsoft.com/open)](https://mran.microsoft.com/open/), an enhanced distribution of R, formerly known as Revolution R Open (RRO). It is a complete open source platform for statistical analysis and data science. The current version, Microsoft R Open 3.3.2, is based on (and 100% compatible with) R-3.3.2 and is therefore fully compatibility with all packages, scripts and applications that work with that version of R. It includes additional capabilities for improved performance, reproducibility, as well as support for Windows and Linux-based platforms.
Like R, Microsoft R Open is open source and free to download, use, and share. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac Os operative systems and you can download it at [www.mran.microsoft.com/download](https://mran.microsoft.com/download/).


#### RStudio, Inc. 

RStudio, Inc. [(www.rstudio.com)](http://www.rstudio.com/) is a company that develops free and open tools for the R community, inspired by the innovations of R users in science, education, and industry. These include the RStudio development environment as well as the `shiny`, `ggvis`, and `dplyr` packages (among many others). RStudio was founded around December 2010 by JJ Allaire, creator of the programming language ColdFusion. Hadley Wickham is the Chief Scientist at RStudio. RStudio has a mission to provide the most widely used open source and enterprise-ready professional software for the R statistical computing environment. These tools will further the cause of expanding the use of R and the field of data science. It also offers open source and enterprise ready tools for the R computing environment. The flagship product of the RStudio team is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes it easy for analysts, scientists, data scientists and quants to perform their analyses. It also offer Shiny: a platform that allows you to take those analyses and share them with your team/organization by creating interactive web applications.
